WeatherService is a web application developed using Node.js platform. It uses Express framework and EJS for templating  
web pages.

This application takes City/State/Country as input and displays the weather condition for that city. To get the weather 
details, it uses Weather Underground API (http://www.wunderground.com/).

It has two paths:
- First path takes one city as input and returns the weather for that city:

To go to this path, just type this in your browser (after you start Node server): http://127.0.0.1:3000

- Second path can accept upto four cities in request and return their weather details using one API call to Node server.

To go to this path, type this in your browser (after you start Node server): http://127.0.0.1:3000/weatherSearchForCities
